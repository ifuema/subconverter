## üçÅAbout

One of the best ad filter lists in the open-source community, providing superior ad blocking, privacy protection, and data savings. It supports various popular network-layer ad-blocking and proxy tools¬π. Unlike other rules with thousands of entries, the AWAvenue Ads Rule prioritize compact size, high hit rates, and low hardware requirements.

By subscribing to this rule, you‚Äôll see pop-up ads disappear, ad feeds at the end of articles won't load, autoplay ads vanish, and even boot ads on TV boxes/smart TVs are gone. Plus, you‚Äôll save some storage space on your device as ad files won‚Äôt download.

Compared to other ad-blocking methods, filtering from the network layer is cost-effective, user-friendly, and widely applicable (e.g., through router deployment). You won‚Äôt need to set up each app individually, and filtering is seamless without disrupting regular app use.

*As of November 2024, our rule blocks over 90% of known ads across Teyvat.*

### *If you have any feedback on this rule, please be sure to check our [FAQs](https://awavenue.top/Knowledge.html#%E5%B8%B8%E8%A7%81%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98-%E4%B8%8E%E7%AD%94%E7%96%91) before submitting an issue or joining the group chat. It may resolve some of your questions.*

## üçÅWork Principle

Using Adblock syntax, we intercept various ad SDKs at the network layer within Android applications, blocking them from loading to achieve ad-free browsing.
